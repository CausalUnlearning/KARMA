<h1>Welcome to SpamBayes</h1>

<p>SpamBayes is an Outlook plugin that provides a spam filter based on
statistical analysis of your personal mail. Unlike many other spam
detection systems, SpamBayes actually learns what you consider spam, and
continually adapts as both your regular email and spam patterns change.</p>

<p>When you first start Outlook after SpamBayes has been installed, the
SpamBayes Installation Wizard will appear. This Wizard will guide
you through the configuration process and allow you to quickly have
SpamBayes filtering your mail. This document contains additional
information which will help make SpamBayes effective from the first
time you use it.</p>

<p>Please remember that this is free software; please be patient, and
note that there are plenty of things to improve. There are ways
you can help, even if you aren't a programmer - you could help with
this documentation, or <a href="http://spambayes.org/donations.html">make a
donation</a>, or any number of other ways - please see the
<a href="http://www.spambayes.org">main project page</a> for information.
The list of <a href="http://www.spambayes.org/faq.html">Frequently Asked
Questions</a> may also answer some of yours.</p>

<p>For more information on SpamBayes, including links to the rest of
the documentation, see <a href="../about.html">About SpamBayes</a>.</p>

<h2>Training</h2>
<p>SpamBayes has no builtin rules, so anything you consider spam will be
treated as spam by this system, even if it does not conform to the
traditional definitions of spam. This means that SpamBayes requires
<tt>training</tt> before it will be effective. There are two ways that this
training can be done:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Allow SpamBayes to learn as it goes. Initially, SpamBayes
  will consider all mail items <tt>unsure</tt>, and each item will be used
  to train. In this scenario, SpamBayes will take some time to become
  effective. It will rarely make mistakes, but will continue to be unsure
  about items until the training information grows. <em>This is the
  training technique that we recommend you use</em>.</li>

  <li>Pre-sorting mail into two folders; one containing only examples
  of good messages, and another containing only examples of spam.
  SpamBayes will then process all these messages gathering the clues it
  uses to filter mail. Depending on how many messages you train
  on, SpamBayes will be immediately effective at correctly classifying
  your mail.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Installation Wizard will guide you through these options.</p>

<p>It is important to note that even when SpamBayes has little training
information, it rarely gets things wrong - the worst it generally does
is to classify a message as <tt>unsure</tt>. However, as mentioned, the
more training information SpamBayes has, the less it is unsure about new
messages. See <em>using the plugin</em>, below, for more information.</p>

<h2>Using the Plugin</h2>
<img alt="SpamBayes Toolbar" style="float:right; margin: 1em"
src="images/manager-select.jpg" />
<p>This section describes how the plugin operates once it is configured.
You can access the SpamBayes features from the SpamBayes toolbar (shown
to the right), but in general, SpamBayes will simply and silently filter
your mail.</p>

<p>As messages arrive, they are given a <tt>spam score</tt>. This score is
the measure of how &quot;spammy&quot; the system has decided a mail is,
with 100% being certain spam, and 0% meaning the message is certainly not
spam. The SpamBayes addin uses these scores to classify mail into
one of three categories - <tt>certain spam</tt>, <tt>unsure</tt>, and good
messages. Good messages are often known in the anti-spam community as
<tt>ham</tt>.</p>

<p>Mail that is classified as good is not touched by this plugin by default
- they will remain in your inbox, or be filtered normally by Outlook's
builtin rules. Typically, and by default, mail that is classified as either
<tt>unsure</tt> or <tt>certain spam</tt> is moved into different folders
for future review.</p>

<p>Outlook does not allow us to automatically add the <tt>spam score</tt>
to your Outlook folder views - but you can <a href="../about.html#Field">do
it manually by following these instructions</a>.</p>

<p>There are three ways in which the system can get things wrong:
<ul>
  <li>A spam stays in your inbox. This is known as a <tt>false
  negative</tt>. In this case you can either drag the message to the spam
  folder or click on the <tt>spam</tt> button on the Outlook toolbar.
  In both cases, the message will be trained as spam and will be moved to
  the spam folder.</li>

  <li>Any message is moved to the unsure folder. In this case,
  the system is simply unsure about the message, and moves it to the
  possible spam folder for human review. All unsure messages should
  be manually classified; good messages can either be dragged back to the
  inbox, or have the <tt>Not Spam</tt> toolbar button clicked, while spam
  messages can either be dragged to the spam folder or have the
  <tt>spam</tt> toolbar button (shown above) clicked. In all cases, the
  system will automatically be trained appropriately.</li>

  <li>A wanted (ham) message is moved to the spam folder. This is known
  as a <tt>false positive</tt>. In this case you can either drag the
  message back to the folder from which it came (generally the inbox), or
  click on the <tt>Not Spam</tt> button. In both cases the message will be
  trained as good, and moved back to the original folder.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that in all cases, as you take corrective action on the mail, the
system is also trained. This makes it less likely that another
similar mail will be incorrectly classified in the future.</p>
