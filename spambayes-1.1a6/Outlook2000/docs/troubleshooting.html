<h2><a name="NoToolbar">Toolbar items appear, but fail to work</a></h2>
<p>If the toolbar items fail to work, we are facing one of two problems.
</p>
<ul>
<li>The addin has failed to load. In this case, along with the
toolbars failing to work, SpamBayes will not be filtering or scoring
any messages. To fix this, see the <a href="#Addin_doesnt_load">Addin
doesn't load instructions</a>.</li>
<li>If the addin has loaded (ie, is filtering and scoring mail) but
the toolbar items don't, we have struck a common problem with the
toolbars. Follow the instructions below.</li>
</ul>

<p>First we will try deleting the toolbar, and if that fails, completely
reset all Outlook toolbars. Perform the following steps:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Right-click on any Outlook toolbar, and select Customize.</li>
  <li>In the dialog that appears, ensure the <tt>Toolbars</tt> tab is
  selected, locate SpamBayes in the list of toolbars, and select it.</li>
  <li>Click on the Delete button. Outlook will ask for confirmation that
  you want to delete the SpamBayes toolbar. Select OK.</li>
  <li>Close the customize dialog. The SpamBayes toolbar no longer appear.
  </li>
  <li>Restart Outlook. SpamBayes will re-create the toolbar.</li>
</ul>

<p>If all else fails, you can completely reset the Outlook toolbars by
removing the file
<tt>\Documents and Settings\{username}\Application Data\Microsoft\Outlook\outcmd.dat</tt>
Although this is undocumented by Microsoft, we have never heard reports
of problems. If you are paranoid, simply rename this file so that you have
a copy.</p>

<h2><a name="Error_during_load">Addin loads with an error message</a></h2>

<p>In this case, when you start Outlook you receive a message indicating
that SpamBayes could not be initialized.</p>

<p>This means that SpamBayes has loaded, but struck an error during
initialization. If the information in the error message does not indicate
the nature of the error, please <a href="#ReportABug">report a bug</a>
(making sure you <a href="#CheckLog">attach the log file</a>).</p>

<h2><a name="Addin_doesnt_load">Addin doesn't load</a></h2>
<p>If you start Outlook but there was no error message, the SpamBayes
toolbar items do not work and new messages have no spam score or
filtering applied, then the plugin has probably become disabled.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#CheckLog">Check the log file</a>. If a log file
for this session exists, then see if it contains an error. If
not, check the date and time of the log - it is probably a log from the
last time it did work, so is no help to us. If a log does exist,
please <a href="#ReportABug">report a bug.</a></li>
  <li>Check that Outlook shows the addin as enabled.</li>
  <p>If you are running from source code, the addin will not appear in the
  steps below. Please re-register the addin, as per the README.txt file.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Start Outlook, and select <tt>Options</tt> from the <tt>Tools</tt>
    menu to display the main Options dialog.</li>
    <li>Select the tab labeled <tt>Other</tt>, then click on the
    <tt>Advanced</tt> button.</li>
    <li>Click on the <tt>COM Add-Ins</tt> button.</li>
    <li>If the SpamBayes addin is not listed, then SpamBayes should be
    reinstalled (Note that running <tt>regsvr32.exe outlook_addin.dll</tt>
    or <tt>bin\outlook_addin_register.exe</tt> from the SpamBayes directory
    may also solve this problem).</li>
    <li>If the SpamBayes addin is listed but not checked, then simply
    check it and close the dialog.</li>
    <li>If you are running <strong>Outlook XP/2002/2003</strong>,
    you may find that if you go back to the dialog, the addin will still be
    unselected. In this case, perform the following:</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Select <tt>About Microsoft Outlook</tt> from the <tt>Help</tt>
    menu.</li>
    <li>Click the Disabled Items button.</li>
    <li>Select SpamBayes.</li>
    <li>Click Enable.</li>
    <li>Restart Outlook.</li>
  </ol>
</ol>
<p>If none of that works, please <a href="#ReportABug">report a bug.</a></p>

<h2><a name="Messages_fail_to_filter">Messages fail to filter</a></h2>
<p>This is when messages arrive, but have no <tt>spam</tt> field value.
Note that this is different from
<a href="#Messages_have_incorrect_or_unexpected">a message having an
incorrect or unexpected spam value</a>. This is for messages that have a
completely blank spam score. To resolve this:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Check that filtering is enabled. Select the SpamBayes Manager, then
  ensure the button Enable Filtering is checked. If you are unable to
  select this button due to insufficient training information, please
  review the <a href="../about.html#Installing_and_Configuring">initial
  configuration documentation for information on training</a>.</li>
  <li>If only the occasional message fails to filter, then it is likely
  that the message is in a format we don't understand. There is almost
  certainly an error listed in the log file. Please
  <a href="#ReportABug">report a bug</a>, attaching both the
  <a href="#CheckLog">log file</a> and the message that caused the error.
  </li>
  <li>If all messages fail to filter, we have a more serious problem but
  again, please <a href="#ReportABug">report a bug</a>, attaching the
  <a href="#CheckLog">log file.</a></li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="Messages_have_incorrect_or_unexpected">Messages have
incorrect or unexpected spam values</a></h2>

<p>This is when filtering appears to work OK, except that the spam values
are wrong. To resolve this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If the messages are all scoring as "unsure", with a score of 0.5,
  then you may have lost your training database. From the
  <tt>SpamBayes Manager</tt> dropdown, check how many spam and good
  messages have been loaded by the system. If this number is very low
  (like zero!) then you probably need to perform a full re-train of your
  database.</li>
  <li>If the messages have apparently random, but unexpected scores,
  then there are two possibilities; either SpamBayes is simply behaving
  what appears to be strangely, but really is correctly, or that some of
  the spam payload is invisible to SpamBayes. In both cases, perform the
  following:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Ensure the message is selected in the Outlook preview pane, and
from the <tt>SpamBayes Manager</tt> dropdown, select <tt>Show Spam clues
for current message</tt>. This should open a new mail message with the
clues.</li>
    <li>Part of the clues shows the body of the spam message. If
this message correctly shows the spam text, then it is likely SpamBayes
is behaving correctly. In this case, you may wish to mail the
clues to the SpamBayes mailing list for help in decoding the clues, but
it is likely that SpamBayes is behaving correctly given your current
training data.</li>
    <li>If it appears that part of the spam payload is missing, then
you have probably stumbled across a bug - please mail the clues to the
mailing list.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<h2><a name="ResetConfiguration">Resetting SpamBayes configuration</a></h2>

<p>In some cases, it may become necessary to reset your SpamBayes
configuration, especially if your configuration becomes invalid.
SpamBayes attempts to detect this situation, but doesn't always get it
right. This section details where critical configuration files
are stored - <a href="configuration.html">more detailed information</a> is
also available.</p>

<p>SpamBayes stores all configuration data in
<a href="#LocateDataDirectory">your data directory</a>. The configuration
information is stored in a file called <tt>[profile name].ini</tt>,
where <tt>profile name</tt> is the name of your Microsoft Outlook profile.
The default profile name is usually <tt>Outlook</tt> or <tt>Microsoft
Outlook Internet Settings</tt>, but Outlook can be configured to use any
number of profiles, with any name.</p>

<p>Note that, in this directory, you may also find a file named
<tt>default_bayes_customize.ini</tt> - this file <strong>is not</strong>
used to configure the Outlook side of SpamBayes - look for any other .ini
files in that directory.</p>

<p>If you delete the configuration file, SpamBayes will be completely
reset. <em>Note you will not lose your training data, only your
configuration information</em>. The next time you start Outlook, the
SpamBayes configuration wizard should appear, guiding you through the
configuration process</p>

<p>Your training data is also stored in this directory, but in files with
a <tt>.db</tt> extension. If you ever want to delete your training
information, remove the two <tt>.db</tt> files in this directory.</p>

<p>You may like to consider backing up this directory.</p>

<h2><a name="register-all-users">SpamBayes is not available for all
users on the machine.</a></h2>

<p>When SpamBayes is installed, by default it is available only for the
user who installed it. This is to allow SpamBayes to appear in
Microsoft Outlook's COM-Addin list, and therefore able to be activated
and de-activated by the user inside Outlook.</p>

<p>It is possible to register the addin so it is available to all users on
a particular machine, which can be useful in enterprise arrangements
where users have 'roaming profiles'.</p>

<p>To register SpamBayes in this way, you must log on as a user with
permissions to modify the system registry, then execute the command
(with the correct path substituted):</p>

<p><tt>"c:\Program Files\SpamBayes\bin\outlook_addin_register.exe" hkey_local_machine</tt></p>

<p>Note that the double-quotes in the above command are significant (and
should be typed).  Because "Program Files" has a space in it, you
<strong>must</strong> surround the entire command name with quotes.
Otherwise, you'll get an error something like:</p>

<p><tt>'c:\Program' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.</tt></p>

<p>If you <a href="#CheckLog">check the installation log</a> after
performing such an install, you should see the following messages:</p>

<p><tt>Registered: SpamBayes.OutlookAddin<br />
Registration complete.<br />
Registration (in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE) complete.</tt></p>

<p>Note the last line, which does not exist when registration is performed
only for the current user. Once you have performed this
registration, the Addin will be available for all users - but as noted
above, it will no longer appear in Outlook's COM-Addin list.</p>

<h2><a name="All_other_problems">All other problems</a></h2>

<p>If you are simply unsure about what SpamBayes is doing, please
<a href="#mail">send a mail to the </a><a href="#mail">SpamBayes mailing
list</a> with as much information as possible. If you are fairly sure you
have struck a bug, then please <a href="#ReportABug">report it</a>.
<strong>Please do not mail any of the contributors directly</strong>.</p>

<h2>Process Descriptions</h2>

<p>This explains some of the processes above in more detail.</p>

<h3><a name="InstallationType">Determine your installation type.</a></h3>

<p>If you are running from Python source code, and installed Python, plus
SpamBayes as separate components, then you are running the <tt>source code
version</tt>. If you downloaded an installer .exe file, then you are
running the <tt>binary version</tt>.</p>

<h3><a name="CheckLog">Check the log file</a></h3>

<p><a href="#InstallationType">Determine your installation type</a>.
If you are running the source code version, then please see README.txt
in the Outlook2000 directory.</p>

<p>If you are running the binary version, the simplest way to get hold of
the most recent log is to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the <tt>SpamBayes Manager</tt> dialog (from the SpamBayes
toolbar).</li>
<li>Click the <tt>Advanced</tt> tab.</li>
<li>Click the <tt>Diagnostics</tt> button.</li>
<li>Click the <tt>View log</tt> button.</li>
</ol>

<p>To find the log manually, you'll need to find your Windows temp
directory, into which the SpamBayes addin writes the log. This directory is
generally <tt>\WINDOWS\TEMP</tt> for Windows 95, 98 and ME, or
<tt>\Documents and Settings\{username}\Local Settings\Temp</tt> for
Windows 2000/XP.</p>

<p>Note that by default, in Windows 2000 and XP, Windows Explorer will not
show the <tt>Local Settings</tt> directory. You can convince Windows
Explorer to show this directory (and therefore allow you to see the
<tt>Temp</tt> directory under it) by doing either:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Select the folder <tt>\Documents and Settings\{username}</tt>.</li>
  <p>This directory should be reflected in the Address Bar.</p>
  <li>In the Address Bar, simply type, at the end, <tt>\Local Settings</tt>
  (thereby giving the full path name), and press <tt>Enter</tt>.</li>
  <p>Windows Explorer will then show this folder, and you can open the
  Temp folder, which is in it.</p>
</ul>
<p>or</p>
<ul>
  <li>Select <tt>Folder Options</tt> from the <tt>Tools</tt> menu.</li>
  <li>Select the <tt>View</tt> tab.</li>
  <li>In the list, select <tt>Show hidden files and folders</tt>.</li>
  <li>Select OK.<li>
  <p>The temp folder will now be visible, and you can then open it.
  You may like to then reset this option back to the default value.</p>
</ul>

<p>The log file for the most recent execution of Outlook is named
<tt>spambayes1.log</tt>, the second most recent is named
<tt>spambayes2.log</tt>, and so on for the four previous runs. You can view
this file with <tt>Notepad</tt>. Usually, you will simply see messages
which indicate that SpamBayes is doing its job; however in some cases there
will be errors in this file. If there are errors, please
<a href="#ReportABug">report a bug</a>.</p>

<h4>If the log file is very large</h4>

<p>This probably means that SpamBayes failed to process a large number of
(or a few, large) emails. In that case, please perform the following steps:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ensure all messages in your watch folders are marked as read.</li>
  <li>Restart Outlook (use <tt>Exit and Sign off</tt> if it is in your
  <tt>File</tt> menu)</li>
  <li>Send yourself a test message, and wait for it to arrive.</li>
  <li>Exit Outlook.</li>
</ul>

<p>You should have a new log file containing the error when classifying
the test message. If no error occurs processing the test message,
the previous large log file will still exist (see above). Either
edit the file using a text editor to extract just the error
information, or zip it up. If you don't know what that means,
please <a href="#mail">send a mail</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="LocateDataDirectory">Locating your Data Directory</a></h3>

<p>SpamBayes stores all configuration and database information in a single
directory. By default, this directory is located under the user's
<tt>Application Data</tt> directory. You can locate this directory by
using the <tt>Show Data Folder</tt> button on the <tt>Advanced</tt> tab of
the main SpamBayes Manager dialog.</p>

<p>If you need to locate it by hand, on Windows NT/2000/XP, it will
probably be
<tt>C:\Documents and Settings\{username}\Application Data\Spambayes</tt>,
or on other versions of Windows it will probably be
<tt>C:\Windows\Application Data\Spambayes</tt>.Note that the
<tt>Application Data</tt> folder may be hidden, so Windows
Explorer may not show it by default, but you can enter the path into
the Address Bar and Explorer will open it.</p>

<p>Note that by <a href="configuration.html">modifying the configuration
files</a>, you can tell SpamBayes to store this data in any directory, so
it is possible your data is being stored elsewhere - contact your network
administrator if this appears to be the case.

<h3>Report a bug</h3>

<p>All SpamBayes bugs are maintained in on <a
