Setting Eudora to use different ports under Windows
---------------------------------------------------
Eudora can be configured to support multiple pop and SMTP servers 
on different localhost ports - at least on Windows. You just can't do it 
from the Tools->Options menu. Eudora reads an ini file, 
eudora.ini, at startup. The format of this file is documented in the help 
files. Open Help-Topics, click on index and search on eudora.ini.

Under W2K (at least) eudora.ini is either in the eudora install directory 
or in the user's settings directory  depending on how you installed Eudora 
(probably C:\Documents and Settings\userid\Application 
Data\Qualcomm\Eudora\eudora.ini)

This is how to configure Eudora 5.1 and Spambayes under Windows. Caution: 
make two copies of eudora.ini - eudora.orig and eudora.new, for example. 
Edit eudora.new. Close Eudora and copy the edited eudora.new to eudora.ini 
and then re-start eudora. If you need to go back to your original settings 
until you get it working with Spambayes, just close Eudora, copy 
eudora.orig to eudora.ini and restart Eudora.

Configure pop3proxy for each of Eudora's personality's pop servers, 
specifying a separate port for each. I used 1110, 1120, 1130 and 1140 for 
the four personalities I have in Eudora. Do the same for smtpproxy - again 
I used 1115, 1125, 1135 and 1145.

To configure Eudora:
         Close Eudora.
         In eudora.new (or whatever you called it) find the section 
starting with [Settings]. This contains settings for the dominant personality.
         Find the line beginning POPAccount. The last part of the account 
name starting with '@' is the server. Change it to @localhost.
         Find the lines beginning SMTPServer and POPServer. They will have 
the server names defined for your dominant personality.
         Change both server names to localhost
         Add the following two lines. Use whatever ports you assigned to 
pop3proxy and smtpproxy for the dominant personality.
                 POPPort=1110
                 SMTPPort=1115

Setting for other personalities are kept in sections begging with 
[Persona-personality_name]. For each personality make the same changes as 
you made for the dominant personality, substituting the proper port numbers.

Copy eudora.new to eudora.ini and re-start Eudora. In the password dialog 
for each personality you should see localhost where you used to see the 
actual server name. You should see the X-Spambayes headers which you can 
filter on. In the web interface (localhost:8880) clicking in the Review 
messages link should show all message processed by Spambayes.


For MacOS 9
-----------
As a result of the MacOS multitasking, the proxy may not work very fast
(reports suggest that at least a Cube or G4 400 is necessary; YMMV).

To handle a network connection to 'localhost', it is easiest to add a host
file.  If you don't have one already, create a text file called "hosts" in
the "Preferences" folder.  The content of the file should be:
	localhost CNAME yourmac.example.com
	yourmac.example.com	A 127.0.0.1
The localhost and 127.0.0.1 values must be exactly like this.  If you don't
know the right value to use for "yourmac.example.com", put anything that
looks like this.  The end of the first line must be the same as the start of
the second line.
When this file is created, go to the "TCP/IP" control panel.  Set the user
level to 'Administrator'.  Click on "Use a host file" and select this file.
Save your changes.

On the Mac, you can transform a Python script into a double-clickable
applet. Just drag & drop the pop3proxy.py script onto the BuildApplet
application. You'll get a double-clickable pop3proxy application.

To setup:
  1. Start pop3proxy and open up a web browser to http://localhost:8880.
  2. Click on the Configuration link.
  3. Ensure that the servers line looks like:
	pop3proxy_servers: pop.example.com:110,mail.example.com:110
  4. And that the ports line looks like:
	pop3proxy_ports: 110, 111

To configure Entourage:
  1. Go to the 'Tools' menu and choose 'Accounts'.
  2. Click on 'New' and choose 'POP'.
  3. Fill in the various fields. For the POP server field, put "localhost".
  4. For the pop.example.com account, you are done.
  5. For the mail.example.com account,  in the "Advance receive option"
     window click on the "Ignore the default POP port" check box and type
     in 111.

To filter with Entourage:
The rule can be:
	If
	    Specific header: X-Spambayes-Classification Contains ham
	then    
	    do nothing
	If
	    Specific header: X-Spambayes-Classification Contains spam
	then    
	    Move message to folder Spam
	If
	    Specific header: X-Spambayes-Classification Contains unsure
	then    
	    Move message to folder Unsure

To configure Eudora:
In Eudora, you will be able to reach only one pop server, since you can
configure only one port number for POP. But on this server, you can access
more than one account.
  1. Go to the 'Tools' menu and choose 'Personalities'.
  2. Create a new personality with the POP server as "localhost".
  Note: You will be able to talk only to the pop.example.com server.

To filter with Eudora:
The rule can be:
	Match
	    Header: X-Spambayes-Classification contains ham
	Action    
	    do nothing
	Match
	    Header: X-Spambayes-Classification contains spam
	Action    
	    Transfer To Spam
	Match
	    Header: X-Spambayes-Classification contains unsure
	Action    
	    Transfer To Unsure
