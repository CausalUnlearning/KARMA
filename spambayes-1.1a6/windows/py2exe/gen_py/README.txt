This directory contains stubs generated by pywin32's 'makepy' utility.

They are in source-control so that it is possible to build the spambayes 
binaries without having the correct Office etc versions installed on the 
build box.  The py2exe script references these files, and compiled versions
of them end up in the library used by spambayes.

To determine the exact versions of the typelibs used to generate the various
files, please just look inside it - all such information is recorded near the
top.  To generate new files, execute makepy.py with the -o option, and
specify the filename you wish to use.
