<h1>Troubleshooting SpamBayes sb_server</h1>
This is a list of common problems, and hopefully their solutions.
Please feel free to suggest additional topics. Currently, we have
the following problems listed:<br>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#NothingHappens">I did the SpamBayes configuration, but my mail doesn't filter</a></li>
  <li><a href="#ExceptionHeader">Mail doesn't filter and there is a "X-SpamBayes-Exception header"</a></li>
  <li><a href="#All_other_problems">All other problems</a></li>
</ul>
Some other resources that may be useful in tracking down any problems:<br>
<ul>
  <li>There is an <a href="http://spambayes.org/faq.html">online
FAQ for SpamBayes</a> with lots of information.</li>
  <li>The <a
 href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/spambayes/spambayes/windows/docs/troubleshooting.html?rev=HEAD">latest
online version of this document</a> may have information added since
release.</li>
</ul>
If you must send someone a mail about SpamBayes, <a href="#mail">please
read this first</a>.<br>

<h2><a name="NothingHappens"></a>I did the SpamBayes configuration, but my mail doesn't filter</h2>
<p>Have you changed your mail client to connect to "localhost", instead of
directly to your mail server?  SpamBayes acts as a "proxy", which means
that your mail client asks for new mail via SpamBayes, so that SpamBayes
can add some information to incoming mail about what type of mail it thinks
that message is.</p>

<h2><a name="ExceptionHeader"></a>Mail doesn't filter and there is a "X-SpamBayes-Exception header"</h2>
<p>If mail stops filtering, have a look at the headers of a message.
If it doesn't have a "X-SpamBayes-Classification" header, but does have
a "X-SpamBayes-Exception" header, this means that something is going
wrong when SpamBayes tries to classify the message.  It's ok if this
happens with one or two messages, but if this happens to every message,
something is wrong.</p>
<p>The most common reason is that something has happened to your
database - if this is the case, then the Exception header probably has
"DBRunRecovery" in it.  Information about this problem rapidly changes,
so please see the <a href="http://spambayes.org/faq.html">online FAQ</a>
for more information.</p>
<p>For all other problems, please <a href="mail">send us a mail</a>,
including a copy of the information in the X-SpamBayes exception header.</p>

<h2><a name="All_other_problems"></a>All other problems</h2>
<p>If you are simply unsure about what SpamBayes is doing, please <a
 href="#mail">send a mail to the </a><a href="#mail">SpamBayes mailing
list</a>
with as much information as possible. If you are fairly sure you
have struck a bug, then please <a href="#ReportABug">report it</a>.
Please do not mail any of the contributors directly.</p>

<h2>Process Descriptions</h2>
<p>This explains some of the processes above in more detail.</p>

<h3><a name="InstallationType"></a>Determine your installation type.</h3>
<p>If you are running from Python source code, and installed Python, plus
SpamBayes as separate components, then you are running the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">source code version</span>. If you
downloaded an installer .EXE file, then you are running the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">binary version</span>.  If you ran
the "sb_service" application, then you are probably running as
a service (although note that SpamBayes will try to fall back
to a regular binary version if the service is unavailable).</p>

<h3><a name="CheckLog"></a>Check the log file</h3>
<p><a href="#InstallationType">Determine your installation type</a>.
If you are running the source code version, you will need to run
sb_server in a command window to get the error messages, unless you
are running as a service.<br />
If you are running as a service and/or the binary version, then SpamBayes
writes a log in your Windows temp directory. This directory is generally
<span style="font-style: italic;">\WINDOWS\TEMP</span> for Windows 9x,
or <span style="font-style: italic;">\Documents and
Settings\{username}\Local
Settings\Temp</span> for Windows 2000/XP.</p>

<p>Note that by default, in Windows 2000 and XP, Windows Explorer will not
show the <span style="font-style: italic;">Local Settings</span>
directory, as it is hidden. You can convince Windows Explorer to
show this directory (and therefore allow you to see the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Temp</span> directory under it by doing
either:<br />
<ul>
  <li>Select the folder <span style="font-style: italic;">\Documents
and Settings\{username}</span>. This directory should be
reflected in the Address Bar. In the Address Bar, simply type at
the end "\Local Settings" (thereby giving that full path name), and
press <span style="font-style: italic;">Enter</span>. Explorer
will then show this folder.</li>
</ul>
or
<ul>
  <li>Select <span style="font-style: italic;">Tools-&gt;Folder Options</span>,
select the <span style="font-style: italic;">View</span> tab, and in
the list, select <span style="font-style: italic;">Show hidden files
and folders</span>. Select OK. This folder will now be
visible. You may like to then reset this option back to the default value.
  </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>For binary users, the log file for the most recent execution of
sb_server is named <span style="font-style: italic;">SpamBayesServer1.log
</span>, the second most recent is named <span style="font-style: italic;">
SpamBayesServer2.log</span>, and so on for the four previous runs. For
those that run as a service, the files are named <span
 style="font-style: italic;">SpamBayesService1.log</span>, and so on. You
can view these files with notepad. Usually, you will simply see messages
which indicate that SpamBayes is doing its job; however in some cases there
will be errors in this file. If there are errors, please
<a href="#ReportABug">report a bug</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="LocateDataDirectory"></a>Locating your Data Directory</h3>
<p>SpamBayes stores all configuration and database information in a single
directory. By default, this directory is located under the user's
<span style="font-style: italic;">Application Data</span>
directory.  At the top of the Configuration Page in the web interface
the full path to your configuration file is listed - this will almost
certainly be in your Data Directory. If you need to locate it by hand, on
Windows NT/2000/XP, it will probably be <span style="font-style: italic;">
C:\Documents and Settings\[username]\Application Data\Spambayes</span>, or
on other versions of Windows it will probably be
<span style="font-style: italic;">C:\Windows\Application Data\Spambayes</span>.
Note that the <span style="font-style: italic;">Application Data </span>
folder may be hidden, so Windows Explorer may not show it by default,
but you can enter the path into the Address Bar and Explorer will open it.
<br />
Note that by modifying the configuration files, you can tell SpamBayes
to store this data in any directory, so it is possible your data is
being stored elsewhere - contact your network administrator if this
appears to be the case.</p>

<h3>Report a bug</h3>
<p>All SpamBayes bugs are maintained in <a
 href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=61702&amp;atid=498103">this
page at sourceforge</a>. Please have a check of the bugs already
reported to see if your bug has already been reported. If not,
open a new bug, making sure to set the Category to <span
 style="font-style: italic;">pop3proxy</span>, and setting the Group to
 the appropriate version. Please also ensure you
attach the <a href="#CheckLog">log file</a> to the bug.<br />
If you are unsure about the bug, or need any assistance, please <a
 href="#mail">send a mail</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="mail"></a>Send a mail</h3>
<p>If all else fails, you may want to send someone a mail. Please
make sure you have read this document thoroughly before doing do.<br />
Your mail should be sent to the <a href="mailto:spambayes@python.org">
SpamBayes mailing list (spambayes@python.org)</a>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Please do not mail any of the contributors

Please ensure this mail contains:<br />
<ul>
  <li>the version of Windows you are using</li>
  <li>the version of SpamBayes</li>
  <li>any log files.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>If you also mention that you read this trouble-shooting guide and are
still stuck, then you will be more likely to get answered! (And
if you can <a href="http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/spambayes">
